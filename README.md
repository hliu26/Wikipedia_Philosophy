# Getting To Philosophy: Wikipedia Page Crawling
Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy

>"Clicking on the first link in the main text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, usually leads to the Philosophy article. In February 2016, this was true for 97% of all articles in Wikipedia, an increase from 94.52% in 2011. The remaining articles lead to an article without any outgoing wikilinks, to pages that do not exist, or get stuck in loops"

## "Method summarized
Following the chain consists of:
1. Clicking on the first non-parenthesized, non-italicized link
2. Ignoring external links, links to the current page, or red links (links to non-existent pages)
3. Stopping when reaching "Philosophy", a page with no links or a page that does not exist, or when a loop occurs"


### Goals:
1. Creating a site similar to: https://www.xefer.com/wikipedia?fbclid=IwAR25EiufRpqfi4kR8oVsyx5a1zj2OUkIQbWP_Lg_ql41vuaRRQdONjYyhhA
2. Create a distribution / Capture a distribution of the number of branches/ page hops required to reach the Philosophy page.
3. Potential cluster or classify pages.
