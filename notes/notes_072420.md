# Notes 
- 7/24/2020 Several issues are still being fixed.

> Most of them are related to bullet points and how to deal with them.
>> Pages such as:
> - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury
> - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology
> - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_science
>> All have bullet points (specifically "ul" tag in html) that may contain hyperlinks 
>> Other instances are that hyperlinks show up in "ul" tag but those are to be avoided (how to account for both?)

## Debating if it would be better to ignore any bullet point text and go straight into main body text hyperlinks
> This would mean a pathway to Philosophy can be found; less cycles should occur


## Pathway to "Philosophy" has changed again.
- Nervous System now goes to -> Biology instead of -> Complex System
- Branches of Science used to go to -> Science but now goes to -> Formal Sciences.
