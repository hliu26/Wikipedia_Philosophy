# Notes 
- 7/18/2020 There have been several issues that I had not noted down but have already fixed:
> Most of them were related to the remove_parentheses function and all_links function
>> These include:

>>> ```python 
>>> #1.
>>> true_owl = Page("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_owl")
>>> #Issue: goes to elf owl and skips the first body of text 
>>> #Fix: some parentheses were not caught, also created remove_table method to focus mainly of body text.
>>>
>>> #2.
>>> us = Page("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States")
>>> jersey = Page("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey")
>>> #Issue with both: next link was: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system
>>> #most likely due to the coordinates location and geo tag being placed in the html
>>> #Fix: added checks if body of texts started with <span> tag in all_links.
>>>
>>> #3.
>>> illinois_river = Page("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_River")
>>> #Issue should go to tributary but goes went to a different page (I can't recall what page)
>>> #It ultimately skipped the first body of text
>>> #Fix: had a parentheses issue where ")" included "href" in remove_parentheses
>>>
>>> #4.
>>> guernsey = Page("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernsey") #should have been english channel
>>> #Issue: Italicized link above main body in disambiguation was caught.
>>> #Fix: There was a coordinate issue from #2, also incorporated catching "text-aligns" into all_links
>>>
>>> #5.
>>> cognition = Page("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition")
>>> threeD = Page("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space")
>>> #Issue: refer to #3 -> parentheses errors 
>>> #Fix: refer to #3
>>>
>>> #6.
>>> mexico = Page("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico")
>>> #Issue: refer to issue #2. 
>>> #Fix: same for issue #2, however there was also a parentheses error in remove_parentheses
>>>
>>> #7.
>>> sonora = Page("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora")
>>> #Issue: goes into the second body of text and skips the first body of text (italics issue)
>>> #Fix: fixed italics issue in remove_parentheses

> There were multiple other errors that fell within the same categories above but most have been fixed. 
> It's likely there are more situations that will arrive in remove_parentheses 

## Something to take note of are the hops that have changed regarding the pathway to "Philosophy"
- Knowledge -> Experience -> Philosophy is no longer correct 
- Knowledge now jumps to -> Perception -> which at some point would jump to Emergence -> Philosophy
- UPDATE: Knowledge -> Perception -> ... -> Symbol grounding problem -> Cognitive Science -> CYCLE (science again)
